# Analysis-of-Toxic-Chemical-Releases-in-US
Since the industrial revolution, toxic chemical releases have been a huge problem all around 
the world. The United States is no exception to that. Various industrial sectors such as textile, 
mining, chemical manufacturing etcetera including the federal facilities, should report to the 
US Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) if they produce more than 25000 pounds of hazardous 
chemicals. The data was explored to rank the top industrial sectors that contributed to most of 
the total chemical releases. These chemical releases include on-site land disposal, air releases, 
surface water discharge, off-site disposal and other releases. The results pointed out to the metal 
mining industry, which had its significant share in the toxic chemicals production. Further, the 
chemicals released in that industry were analysed and the mostly released chemical ‘Lead 
Compounds’ was visualised for a period of time across the different states in America. 
Surprisingly, Texas, Idaho and Ohio were highly contaminated most of the time. In addition to 
that, other chemical compounds which were contributing to on-site land disposal were also 
analysed during various timelines.
